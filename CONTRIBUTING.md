# Do not create issues here directly
This is a public repository used to track issues, bugs and upcoming features for future releases of [RestrictData](http://restrictdata.com). 

If you've encountered a problem and you need some help, please use our [support forum](http://help.restrictdata.com). This helps us to triage issues and make sure we don't miss anything important. We want our backlog to reflect things we've committed to doing in the near future, and we like to keep it to below 50 items or less. If you post here it directly will likely not get a reply but if you contact support we can make sure the issue gets prioritized properly.

If you have an idea or a feature request, please contact support.
